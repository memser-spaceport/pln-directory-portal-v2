 * In-app apply on the job board: sign-up banner, apply/applied slot on rows,
 * profile drawer, apply modal. Code-level (not env) on purpose — the flow must
 * ship for everyone at once when the backend contract lands.
 *
 * Gate the WORK, not the render: the flag is imported ONLY by the board host
 * (`JobsContent`) — leaf components receive props or don't, and the new query
 * hooks take it via `enabled:`. Write it literal-first in `&&` guards so the
 * bundler folds the branch.
 *
 * ON while the backend is mocked: applications and the job search status live
 * in `job-applications.mock.ts` (session-scoped, never persisted server-side).
 * Nothing is sent to a hiring team yet — see that file's cutover note.
