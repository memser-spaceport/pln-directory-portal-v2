## Contribution Guidelines

If you are contributing to this repository, please follow these guidelines:

1. Minimal use of external packages  
   Only add a new package if it is absolutely necessary. Unnecessary dependencies can increase the bundle size and introduce maintainability issues.

2. Styling conventions  
   - Use `style jsx` for styling components.  
   - Use `module.css` files for styling the pages.

3. CSS Class Naming (Custom BEM Convention)  
   Use a custom BEM-like convention where each elementâ€™s class name is prefixed with its parent and ancestor class names, separated by double underscores.  
   Example:
   ```jsx
   <div className="member">
     <p className="member__name">John</p>
     <div className="member__profession">
       <p className="member__profession__org">Protocol Labs</p>
       <p className="member__profession__desig">Developer</p>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```
4. **Unit Testing**  
   Add or update unit tests for any component you create or modify. Tests should cover expected behaviors, edge cases, and component interactions where applicable.

5. **Naming Conventions**  
   Use clear, descriptive names for all variables, functions, and components. Avoid vague names like `data1`, `item`, or `temp`. Instead, prefer names that reflect the purpose or content of the variable or function.

6. **PostHog Analytics**  
   Ensure analytics events are added for all call-to-actions and key user operations. Follow these naming rules:
   - Use lowercase letters only  
   - Use present-tense verbs (e.g., `submit`, not `submitted`)  
   - Use snake_case format

   Format: `category_object_action`  
   Examples:
   - `signup_flow_submit_button_click`  
   - `account_settings_email_update_submit`
